# SPV Mining / Old Bitcoin Core
The following pools are known or strongly suspected to be mining on top of blocks before fully validating them with Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 or later. Miners doing this have already lost over $50,000 USD during the 4 July 2015 fork and have created a situation where small numbers of confirmations are much less useful than they normally are.
BTC Nuggets
F2Pool[5]
AntPool[5]
The following pools are believed to be currently fully validating blocks with Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 or later (0.10.2 or later recommended due to DoS vulnerabilities):
BitMinter
BTC China (described as SPV mining[5], but they're performing effective valiation)
BTC Public Mining Pool
CKPool
Eligius
Golden Nonce Pool
P2Pool
Slush Pool
BCMonster.com

↑ Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 Note that pool hashrate is largely irrelevant but can be seen as a popularity measurement. It is a theoretical security issue if one pool gains above 50% of the total computational power of the network, thus consider joining a pool based on other metrics. The pool's total hash rate is very dynamic on most pools. Over time, as the network grows, so does most pool's hash rates. The displayed values are the pool's relative sizes based on the network: Small: less than 2%, Medium: 2%-10% Large: greater than 10% of the network.
